## Today's topics
 * Create a name for this project-group
 * Setup IDE's, git, .gitignore and much more
 * Discussing the task('s)
 * Plan the strucure of the project
 * Assign the tasks to the members of this project


### Create a name for this project-group

We decided to name our group for this project `ZeNaMiKe`. 
We took the first two letters of our first names.


### Setup IDE's git, .gitignore and much more

Deciding an standard was important. We set the 'right marging' in our IDE's at 80 for example. 

Created the git repository and fixed errors which a member had with git. Also generated a `.gitignore` with [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io). You can see the output from the site in the `.gitignore` which is in the parent directory of this.directory. It was easier to generate it than to think of every possible extension we don't want in our repository by accident.

### Discussing the task('s)

Making some point clear which haven't been clear to members of the project.
E.g. the definition of an 'Aufgabenkatalog' and which kind of 'Babystep' might have been meant.

### Planning the structure of the project

We decided to plan the structure of our program with CRC cards, which can be found in the `CRCCARDS.MD`.
These CRC-cards which are shown are a brainstorm of the classes and interfaces we will need. Later on we will add more CRC-cards.

### Assign the tasks to the members of this project

Nadine Foerster: Dealing with the XML-Parsing related tasks including XML-Writer and XML-Reader.

Michael Liske: Dealing with the GUI including the controller and the controller-loader.

Kevin Dreyer: Dealing with the test cycle and its components namely the classes which can be found in the package Cycle.

Zeljko Bekcic: Dealing with all the plugin related tasks including the PlugInLoader and PlugInManager as well as the plugins itselves.
